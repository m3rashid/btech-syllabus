### Object Oriented Programming

1. OOPs using C++

   - Object Oriented Paradigm
   - Structured vs Object Oriented Development
   - Concept of Object and classes
   - Encapsulation
   - Polymorphism
   - Inheritance Generic Programming
   - Merits and demerits of OOP. Class specification
   - Class objects
   - Defining member function
   - Inline functions
   - Data Hiding
   - Empty class
   - Pointers inside a class
   - Passing objects as parameters
   - Returning objects from functions
   - Friend function and class
   - Static data and member functions.
   - Constructors and destructors
   - overloading of constructors
   - Dynamic initialization through constructors
   - Copy constructors
   - Static data members with constructors and destructors. Pointers to objects
   - Array of objects
   - this pointer
   - Self-referential classes.

2. Polymorphism and Operator Overloading

   - Function and Operator overloading
   - Overloading of unary and Binary operators
   - Limitations of overloading of increment and decrement operators
   - overloading of arithmetic
   - Relational
   - assignment
   - new and delete
   - subscript operators.
   - Data conversion between objects.
   - Complete conversion.
   - Overloading through friend functions.
   - Tracing of memory leaks.

3. Inheritance and Virtual Functions

   - Declaration of derived class
   - forms of inheritance
   - constructors and destructors in derived class
   - types of inheritance
   - abstract class
   - Virtual functions: Need of virtual functions
   - Pointers to derived class objects
   - pure virtual functions
   - Virtual destructors
   - Rules of writing virtual function

4. Object Oriented Programming using Java

   - Classes, objects and constructor in Java
   - Implementing inheritance and polymorphism - dynamic binding
   - method overriding
   - abstract classes and methods. Interfaces - Interfaces vs. Abstract classes
   - defining an interface
   - implementing interfaces
   - accessing implementations through interface references
   - extending interfaces. Packages: Defining
   - Creating and Accessing a Package
   - importing packages.

5. Exception Handling and Multithreading

   - Exception handling - Dealing with errors
   - benefits of execution handling
   - the classification of exceptions- exception hierarchy
   - checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions
   - usage of try
   - catch
   - throw
   - throws and finally, re-throwing exceptions
   - exception specification
   - built in exceptions
   - creating own exception sub classes.
   - Multithreading
   - Difference between multiple processes and multiple threads
   - thread states
   - creating threads
   - interrupting threads
   - thread priorities
   - synchronizing threads.
