### Data Structures and Algorithms

1.  Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

    - Definition of Data Structure
    - Types & characteristics of Data structures
    - Abstract Data Type (ADT)
    - Objectives of algorithms
    - Quality of an algorithm
    - Space complexity and Time complexity of an algorithm
    - Characteristics of an array
    - Definition of an Array
    - Implementation of 1-D arrays
    - Row and Column Major Implementations of 2-D, 3-D and n-D arrays.
    - Advanced concept of Pointers in C
    - Dynamic allocation of Memory.

2.  Stacks and queues

    - Stack as a ADT
    - operations on stack
    - Stack implementation using array and linked list
    - Applications of Stack: Polish and reverse Polish notations
    - Recursion
    - Garbage collection. Queue as ADT
    - Operations on queue and Types of queues: Linear Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue and Double Ended Queue
    - Applications of Queue.

3.  Concept of a Linked List

    - Linear Single and Double link lists
    - Circular Single and Double link List
    - Generalized Linked List
    - Header Linked list
    - Applications of Link List.

4.  Concepts of a Tree

    - Tree as ADT
    - Definitions of n-ary
    - binary trees
    - Terms associated with trees. Operations on tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Tree traversal Algorithms
    - AVL Trees
    - Threaded binary trees
    - Heap Tree
    - Expression tree
    - Huffman Tree
    - B – Tree and B+ Tree.

5.  Graph: Different terminology associated with Graphs

    - Types of graphs – directed/undirected
    - connected/disconnected
    - cyclic/acyclic
    - Representation of graphs: Adjacency matrix
    - linked list. Graph Traversal – BFS, DFS
    - Graph algorithm: Warshall’s, Djikastra’s
    - Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithm.
    - Sequential Sort
    - Shell Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Topology sort.
